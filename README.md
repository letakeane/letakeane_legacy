## Reflection
I built this site at the end of my third (of four) module at Turing School of Software and Design.


#### The stack:
* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
* The app is built primarily with React and Router.
* Also used: JSX, CSS.
* The live site is deployed on Surge.sh.


#### Future goals:
* Keep the site current with new projects and skills.
* Add in accessibility:
  * WAI-ARIA labels and props
  * A 'skip to main content' link
* Build in a stick-nav for the mobile sizes

  - Sketch (used to create the original design of the site)
  - Affinity Designer (used to create the mineral-crystal logo)

## Acknowledgements
  I need to thank Jeff Duke for his advice and the tip to use Surge.sh to host my react site. Many thanks also to the instructors at Turing, and my cohort 1701-fe (in particular John Binning and Laura Turk for their PR reviews and general encouragement).
